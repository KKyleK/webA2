1. list scrollable?


5. Be sure to style the play details nicely using contrast and spacing (STYLE)


7. (Optional for correctness) data-id attribute of the <li> for the

10. Add the header   ---->>>>> 


12. When play clicked (midsummerNight dream) It says dream in blue. Might want to change that
