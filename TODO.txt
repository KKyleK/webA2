1. the list must be made scrollable by setting the overflow-y
 property of the container to scroll. Ideally, add an icon to 
those plays that have text available

2: The three links must be working hyperlinks (Dont but the link 
put some link and then give it src = "")

3.when a play is selected, change its appearance in the list so 
that the user has some visual feedback (use classList.add()
 to add a class to the element)

4.If the filename property of the play is empty, then there is no 
play text available; in such a case, simply hide the button
 (change its display property to none).

5. Be sure to style the play details nicely using contrast and spacing (STYLE)

6. When no plays have been selected yet (i.e., when page is first viewed), 
don’t display anything in the second column (except a background color 
in the second column), and in the third column display 
“Select a play to see details”. This message will disappear once a play
 is selected.

7. (Optional for correctness) data-id attribute of the <li> for the 
play as a query string, as shown in the comments in assign2.js

8. populate the <section  id="playHere">, <article id="actHere">,
 and <div id="sceneHere"> elements with the first scene from the 
first act of the selected play.

9.Add event handlers to the <select> elements. They will change
 what part of the play is displayed.

10. Add the header


11. Store each API request.

12. When play clicked (midsummerNight dream) It says dream in blue. Might want to change that
